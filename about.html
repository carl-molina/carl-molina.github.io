  <h1>Hi, my name's Carl!</h1>
  <h2>I'm a filmmaker turned software engineer.</h2>
  <p>For the last five years, my day job was a Field Operator Specialist for autonomous
    vehicle operations. By night, I was a Bay Area filmmaker writing and directing films,
    and winning some awards along the way! My passion for computers and software was
    always there, though: from taking Intro to Comp Sci in highschool, Modern Web Apps in
    college, and taking CS courses at De Anza College, I love everything about coding.
    Now, I've decided to pursue this passion as a career in order to contribute more as
    a software engineer on the other side of test and development. You can find me deep
    in studying, journaling in cafes around the Greater SF Bay Area, or hiking trails
    on the peninsula.
